# assignment3
Task 1 :
  I defined a func named factorial and used 'n' as a variable to its argument
  I then used if cuz there are conditions for factorial 
  I put if n < 2 then return 1 czu factorial of 1 and 0 is '1'
  And for the mathematical aspect of the code i used else :
    and i used a recusrsive func so that i can get an ineteger less than the previous one and multiply all of them as this is the basic definition of a factoial
  i then asked for user input and saved it as a variable named 'num'
  i then used num as the argument and called the function inside the print statement using a formatted string


Task 2 :
  I imported math module and used its functions ( some of them)
  I asked for user to input a number 
  i used 'sqrt' , 'log' , 'sin' functions and saved them in their respective variables and used user input as their input values
  And printed the result as formatted string
